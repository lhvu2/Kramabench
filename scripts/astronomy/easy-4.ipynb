Determine the approximate period of solar activity cycles and identify the top five years of minimum and maximum activity between 1960 and 2020 using historical yearly mean sunspot numbers. To be considered as a maximum, a peak needs to have a prominence of 20 and distance of 5. Similar rules apply for the minimum."
