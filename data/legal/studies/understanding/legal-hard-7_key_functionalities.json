    "Treat two columns as swapped: keep rows whose 'Theft Type' field contains the years 2020 or 2024 (so 'Theft Type' is actually the year and 'Year' is the fraud category).",
    "Select only categories that have data for both 2020 and 2024 to ensure valid comparison.",

    "Identify the category with the largest growth_ratio (idxmax) and output that category name (title-cased) as the fastest-growing fraud type between 2020 and 2024."
