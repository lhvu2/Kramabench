    "Read the Excel workbook and load the sheet that contains the FDR values.",
    "Keep only the columns that identify the gene and its FDR value.",
    "Group the data by gene and compute the mean FDR for every gene.",
    "Retrieve the average FDR calculated for the gene named CBX3.",
    "Create a subset of the data that excludes all CBX3 rows and compute the overall mean FDR for this remaining set of genes.",
    "Subtract the mean FDR of the non-CBX3 genes from the mean FDR of CBX3 to obtain the requested difference."
