Specifically, use a 16-hour context window to project the input time series forward using a VAR(1) model, then fit a linear regression model to predict the next 4 hours of density. Use data from wu334 (OMNI/GOES: 2016-10-22 to 2016-10-23; Density: 2016-10-23 to 2016-10-24) for training, and wu335 (OMNI/GOES: 2016-10-25 to 2016-10-26; Density: 2016-10-29) for evaluation. Assume that all windows contain valid data. Note that the data for training VAR lies at the end of the OMNI2 and GOES input window, and the corresponding Swarm Alpha density data begins immediately afterward; i.e., they only overlap at a single timestamp where OMNI/GOES ends and Density begins. Report the RMSE between the predicted and observed density values over the 4-hour forecast window.",
